# Charter for the RDF-star Working Group

This repository has two "main" branches:

- `active` should reflect the currently [active](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/rdf-star/charters/active/) charter of the WG
- `upcoming` is the current state of the next proposed charter

In general, `active` should be equal or behind `upcoming`,
but it may happen that `active` diverges when the active charter is extended while a new one is being developped.

Preview of the charter:
